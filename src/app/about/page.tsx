        <p className="text-lg">
          Hi there! Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm a passionate software engineer
          with a love problem solving and learning. I specialize in backend
          development and advanced knowledge of algorithms and data structures.
          I also have a blossoming love for indie game development.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a software engineer, I've interned at Statsig and Lockheed Martin.
          I have also been on my University's competitive programming team for
          the past four years and have competed in the ACM ICPC Southeast USA
          regional competition as well as online on sites like Codeforces and
          CodeChef.
          <br />
          <br />
          I am about to graduate with a degree in Computer Science and I'm
          excited to apply my skills to real-world problems. When I'm not
          coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, playing video
          games, or diving into a good book.
          <br />
