          Hi there! Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm a passionate software engineer with a love problem solving and learning. 
          I am about to graduate with a degree in Computer Science and I'm excited to apply my skills to real-world problems. 
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, playing video games, or diving into a good book.
